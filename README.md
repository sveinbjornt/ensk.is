**A free and open English-Icelandic dictionary**

This repository contains the data files and software for
[ensk.is](https://ensk.is), a free and open public domain
online English-Icelandic dictionary.

## Download

You can download the dictionary in the following formats:

* [⇩ SQLite3 database](https://ensk.is/static/files/ensk.is.db.zip)
* [⇩ CSV document](https://ensk.is/static/files/ensk.is.csv.zip)
* [⇩ Plain text](https://ensk.is/static/files/ensk.is.txt.zip)

## Background

The author of the original dictionary, Geir T. Zoëga (1857-1928),
was an English language teacher and later rector at the Learned
School of Reykjavík in the years 1883-1927. The first edition was
published in 1896. The digitised, extended and sanitised version
presented here is based on the
[much-improved 1932 edition](https://baekur.is/bok/000132498/0/2/Ensk-islenzk_ordabok)
edited by Þorsteinn Þorsteinsson.

The current incarnation of the dictionary has been heavily edited and
extensively updated to accord with modern Icelandic orthography.
Many additions were made to bring the vocabulary into the 21st
century. Various errors in the original text were also corrected.

## Contributing

The raw dictionary text files are stored [here](data/dict/).

Additions can be viewed [here](data/dict/_add.txt).

## Deployment

Ensk.is an ASGI web application implemented using the
[FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) Python web framework.
To deploy it, you need to set up a Python virtual
environment (3.12+) and install dependencies:

```sh
virtualenv -p /path/to/python3 venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To build the dictionary data files from plain text source files,
run the following command:

```sh
python gen.py
```

Run the web application via [`uvicorn`](https://www.uvicorn.org/):

```sh
uvicorn app:app --reload
```

Should also work with any other reasonable ASGI server.

## Development

All new dictionary entries should be appended to [data/dict/_add.txt](data/dict/_add.txt).

To verify the syntax and references of all entries, you can run:

```sh
python verify.py
```
