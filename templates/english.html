<h1 lang="en">About ensk.is</h1>

<p lang="en"><a href="/"><strong>ensk.is</strong></a> is a <em>free and open public
        domain online English-Icelandic dictionary.</em></p>

<p lang="en">The author of the original dictionary, Geir T. Zoëga (1857-1928), was an
    English language teacher and later rector at the Learned School of Reykjavík
    in the years 1883-1927. His last edition was published in 1928. The digitised,
    extended and sanitised version presented here is based on the much-improved
    third edition (1932) edited by Þorsteinn Þorsteinsson.</p>

<p lang="en">This new edition of the dictionary has been comprehensively updated and modernised.
    The text now conforms to modern Icelandic orthography, various errors in the original text were
    corrected, and the vocabulary has been significantly expanded to reflect contemporary usage.</p>

<p lang="en">The dictionary currently contains <a href="/all">{{ num_entries }} entries</a>,
    of which <a href="/additions">{{ num_additions }}</a>
    are new additions ({{ additions_percentage }}). More statistics <a href="/stats">here</a>.</p>

<p lang="en">Ensk.is provides <a href="/docs">an easy-to-use JSON API</a>. However,
    for bulk processing or low-latency applications, the <a href="/files">downloadable
        version</a> is recommended.</p>

<p lang="en">The current editor and maintainer is
    <a href="mailto:sveinbjorn@sveinbjorn.org">Sveinbjörn Þórðarson</a>.
