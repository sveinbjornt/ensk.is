* Find IPA phonetic spelling for *all* words via Wiktionary
* Feedback mechanism for missing words
* Separate exact match from partial matches visually

* Add step to verify.py: check that adjectives are always defined using the masculine
* In item view, parse and break down the different word cat definitions and examples, show to user in a nice, easily understandable way
* If no result found, lemmatize word and try again? Be smart?
